# Intro-to-Computer-Science

Here is the coursework taken for the second part of the intro to computer science series at UCLA, taught by Dr. Smallberg.

The project 4 is the most extensive project completed, meant to resemble a Netflix-like movie recommendator program. 

Additionally, project 3 involved an object-oriented mario-like video game. 

I included several zipped, complete projects, as well as miscellaneous coding examples from the coursework projects and homework.
